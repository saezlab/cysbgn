SBGNplugin -
		SBGN (http://www.sbgn.org/Main_Page) assumes to be the standard graphical notation for 
	systems biology. This plug-in adds the support to Cytoscape to load SBGN-ML networks.


NOTE :
		Due to some Cytoscape representation limitations (e.g. no support for custom edges shapes) 
	some of the edges and nodes shapes are not represented exactly as they should be.
